##  Projects

## 📊 Featured Projects

### 🏠 House Price Prediction with Simple Linear Regression
- **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Google Colab  
- **Description:**  
  This project explored how house size (in square feet) relates to its selling price. It involved loading and preparing data, applying simple linear regression using Scikit-learn, training the model, and making predictions.  
  While the task seemed mathematically simple, the real value came in learning the end-to-end workflow: from data preparation to interpretation of regression coefficients.

### 🌐 Web Scraping with Python and BeautifulSoup
- **Tools Used:** Python, Requests, BeautifulSoup, Google Colab  
- **Description:**  
  In this project, I practiced web scraping techniques using Python libraries to extract structured data from websites. I learned how to send HTTP requests, parse HTML content, and extract useful information for analysis and visualization.  
  This was a hands-on exercise in automating data collection for real-world web pages.

### 🏘️ California Housing Price Prediction (KNN Regression & Pipeline)
- **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, GridSearchCV, Google Colab  
- **Description:**  
  In this project, I worked on predicting housing prices using the California Housing dataset. I implemented a complete ML workflow using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression:
  - Loaded and explored the dataset  
  - Built a preprocessing pipeline  
  - Performed train-test split  
  - Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV with 5-fold cross-validation  
  - Evaluated performance using R² and RMSE  
  - Saved the best model  
  This enhanced my understanding of end-to-end machine learning, including model tuning and deployment practices.

### 🍷 Wine Quality Classification with 6 ML Algorithms
- **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Google Colab  
- **Description:**  
  In this project, I applied and compared six classification algorithms on the Wine dataset from Scikit-learn:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Naive Bayes  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  I performed data exploration, preprocessing, training, and evaluation using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports to determine which algorithm performed best.
